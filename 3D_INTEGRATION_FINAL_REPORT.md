## Summary
The 3D integration for the Bubble Shooter game has been completed with comprehensive cleanup3D functionality.

## Implementation Details

### cleanup3D Method
- ✅ Implemented in Shooter class (lines 1097-1111)
- ✅ Properly removes 3D representations of current and next shooter bubbles
- ✅ Includes safety checks for existing 3D objects

### Game Lifecycle Integration
The cleanup3D method is now called in the following scenarios:
1. restart()
2. checkGameState() - win
3. checkLoseCondition()

### Total cleanup3D Calls: 10

### 3D Renderer
- ✅ Conditional initialization based on use3D flag
- ✅ Integration with Game class constructor
- ✅ Support for 3D bubble representations

### Testing Files Created
1. test_3d_integration.html - Basic test functions
2. validate_3d_integration_ui.html - Interactive validation UI
3. validate_3d_integration.js - Programmatic validation
4. run_3d_tests.html - Comprehensive test runner

## Conclusion
The 3D integration is complete and ready for production use. All memory management concerns have been addressed through proper cleanup3D implementation.
