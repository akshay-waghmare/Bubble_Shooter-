# Possible Framework Suggestions

Here are some frameworks you might consider for your project:

## Web Development
- **Django** (Python)
- **Flask** (Python)
- **Express.js** (Node.js)
- **Ruby on Rails** (Ruby)
- **ASP.NET Core** (C#)

## Frontend Development
- **React**
- **Vue.js**
- **Angular**
- **Svelte**

## Mobile Development
- **React Native**
- **Flutter**
- **SwiftUI**
- **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile**

## Machine Learning
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **scikit-learn**

## Testing
- **Jest**
- **PyTest**
- **Mocha**

## Game Development
- **Phaser.js** (JavaScript): Use for 2D rendering, UI, and animation.
- **Three.js** (JavaScript): Use for advanced 3D effects and visuals.

> **Hybrid Approach Recommendation:**
> For this project, consider a hybrid approach: use Phaser.js for 2D game logic, UI, and animation, while retaining Three.js for advanced 3D rendering. Integrate by either rendering Three.js scenes to textures for use in Phaser, or overlaying Phaser's canvas/UI on top of a Three.js canvas. This leverages the strengths of both frameworks and modernizes your codebase without losing 3D features.

Choose the framework that best fits your project requirements and team expertise.
