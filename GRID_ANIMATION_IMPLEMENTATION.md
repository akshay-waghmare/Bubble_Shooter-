# Grid Animation Implementation - TDD Approach

## Summary
This implementation adds smooth grid animations after players pop multiple rows of bubbles at once. When 3 or more rows are cleared in a single match AND the bubbles are visible in the top 5% of the viewport, the grid moves down more quickly to introduce new bubbles into the play area, maintaining game engagement.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Constants and Configuration
```javascript
// Grid animation settings for multi-row pops
const GRID_ANIMATION_DURATION = 400; // ms (fast animation for better responsiveness)
const GRID_ANIMATION_DISTANCE_FACTOR = 1.5; // Multiplier for row distance
```

### 2. Animation Properties Added to Game Class
```javascript
// Initialize grid animation properties
this.gridAnimating = false;      // Flag to track active animation
this.gridAnimStart = 0;          // Animation start timestamp
this.gridAnimDuration = 400;     // Duration in milliseconds (reduced from 800ms)
this.gridAnimDistance = 0;       // How far to move the grid
this.gridStartY = 0;             // Starting grid offset position
```

### 3. Animation Trigger Method
```javascript
animateGridAfterPop(rowsPopped, poppedBubblesInViewport) {
    // Only animate if bubbles were popped in top part of viewport and enough rows affected
    if (rowsPopped >= 3 && poppedBubblesInViewport) {
        this.gridAnimating = true;
        this.gridAnimStart = Date.now();
        this.gridStartY = this.gridOffsetY;
        
        // Calculate distance based on rows popped (cap at 3x factor for very large pops)
        this.gridAnimDistance = GRID_ROW_HEIGHT * GRID_ANIMATION_DISTANCE_FACTOR * 
            Math.min(3, rowsPopped - 2);
    }
}
```

### 4. Animation Update Method
```javascript
updateGridAnimation() {
    if (this.gridAnimating) {
        const elapsed = Date.now() - this.gridAnimStart;
        
        if (elapsed >= this.gridAnimDuration) {
            // Animation complete
            this.gridAnimating = false;
            this.gridOffsetY = this.gridStartY + this.gridAnimDistance;
            return true;
        } else {
            // Apply easing function for smooth animation
            const progress = elapsed / this.gridAnimDuration;
            const easeOut = 1 - Math.pow(1 - progress, 2); // Quadratic ease-out
            this.gridOffsetY = this.gridStartY + (this.gridAnimDistance * easeOut);
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### 5. Game Update Method Modification
The update method now prioritizes animation movement over normal continuous scrolling:
```javascript
// Inside update()
if (this.gridAnimating) {
    // Update animation state
    this.updateGridAnimation();
    
    // Don't apply normal scrolling during animation
    this.targetScrollOffset = this.gridOffsetY;
} 
else if (CONTINUOUS_SCROLL_ENABLED) {
    // Normal scrolling when not animating
    // ...existing scrolling code...
}
```

### 6. Row Detection in popBubbles Method
```javascript
// Inside popBubbles()
let minRow = Infinity;
let maxRow = -Infinity;

for (const bubble of bubbles) {
    // Track min/max rows for animation
    minRow = Math.min(minRow, bubble.row);
    maxRow = Math.max(maxRow, bubble.row);
    
    // ...existing bubble removal code...
}

// Calculate how many rows were affected
const rowsPopped = maxRow - minRow + 1;

// Trigger grid animation for multi-row pops
this.animateGridAfterPop(rowsPopped);
```

## TDD Approach
The implementation followed a test-driven development approach:

1. **Test Cases:**
   - Multi-row pop detection
   - Animation initialization
   - Easing function validation
   - Animation completion

2. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**
   - Started with failing tests
   - Implemented minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactored for clean integration

3. **Visual Testing:**
   - Created a visual test to verify animation smoothness
   - Tested various row counts to verify proportional movement

## Benefits
- **Increased Game Speed:** Keeps gameplay flowing smoothly after large bubble pops
- **Visual Feedback:** Provides satisfying feedback for player achievements
- **Game Balance:** Ensures players always have bubbles to interact with
- **Smooth Animation:** Uses easing function for natural movement

## Scaling
The animation distance scales with the number of rows popped:
- 3 rows: Basic animation (1.5 * row height)
- 4 rows: 2x animation (3.0 * row height)
- 5+ rows: 3x animation (4.5 * row height, maximum)

This provides proportional feedback while preventing excessively large movements.
