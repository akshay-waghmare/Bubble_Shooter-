# Off-Screen Bubble Popping Fix Summary

## Issue Overview
Bubbles outside the visible viewport (far above the screen) were being popped when players made matches with visible bubbles. This caused confusing gameplay where players couldn't see all the consequences of their actions.

## Solution Implemented
We modified the `isBubbleVisibleOrNearVisible` method to use stricter viewport boundary settings:

1. Reduced the buffer zone above the viewport from `BUBBLE_RADIUS * 4` to `BUBBLE_RADIUS * 2`
2. This halved the distance above the viewport where bubbles can be considered "near visible"
3. The existing implementation of `checkMatches()` and `findFloatingBubbles()` already used this method to filter results

## Benefits of the Solution
1. **Minimally intrusive**: The fix only required changing a single parameter value
2. **Maintains gameplay feel**: Bubbles just above the viewport still pop to give a natural transition
3. **No game logic changes**: The core matching and floating bubble mechanics remain the same
4. **Optimized performance**: Fewer bubbles being processed for popping and falling animations

## Testing
The fix was verified using the test_visibility_fix.html test page which specifically tests:
1. Visible matches detection
2. Floating bubble detection
3. Score calculation based on visible bubbles only

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring player feedback on bubble popping behavior
- Consider adding visual indicators when matches extend slightly off-screen

This fix fulfills the requirements of making gameplay more predictable and visually coherent for players while making the minimal necessary changes to the existing codebase.
